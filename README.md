🤖 DataOracle AI: The Autonomous Data Scientist Agent

DataOracle AI is a production-grade, multi-agent platform designed to automate the entire data science lifecycle. Built with a LangGraph back-end and a React-Vite front-end, it transforms raw CSV files into structured "Executive Intelligence Reports" using high-speed LLM reasoning (Groq/Llama 3.3).

## System Overview
Unlike traditional dashboard tools, DataOracle AI acts as an Agentic Reasoning Engine. It doesn't just display data; it audits, cleans, researches, visualizes, and critiques its own findings before presenting them to the user.

## Core Agentic Workflow (Nodes)

 --> The Auditor: Performs a heuristic analysis of the dataset, assigning a "Data Health Grade" (A-F).
 
 --> The Sanitizer: Automatically handles missing values and data-type inconsistencies using statistical medians and modes.
 
 --> The Context Weaver: Injects real-world market trends (2024-2025) into the analysis to provide "The Why" behind the numbers.
 
 --> The Multi-Plot Coder: Dynamically generates and executes Python Seaborn scripts in a sandboxed environment.
 
 --> The Critic: An internal peer-review node that checks for hallucinations and ensures report accuracy.
 
 -->The Interactive Oracle: A stateful chat agent with conversational memory for ad-hoc follow-up questions.
